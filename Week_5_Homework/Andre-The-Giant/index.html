        Early Life
      </h2>
      <p>
        André René Roussimoff was born in Grenoble of Slavic heritage, the third
        of five children, to Boris and Marianne Roussimoff. As a child, he
        displayed symptoms of gigantism very early, reaching a height of 191 cm
        (6 ft 3 in) and a weight of 94 kg (208 lb) by the age of 12.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roussimoff was a good student, particularly in mathematics, but he
        dropped out after the eighth grade since he did not think having a high
        school education was necessary for a farm labourer. He spent years
        working on his father's farm in Molien. He also completed an
        apprenticeship in woodworking, and next worked in a factory that
        manufactured engines for hay balers.

        At the age of 18, Roussimoff moved to Paris and was taught professional

      />

      <h2>
        Acting Career
      </h2>

      <p>
        Roussimoff branched out into acting in the 1970s and 1980s, after a 1967
        French boxing film, making his USA acting debut playing a Sasquatch
        ("Bigfoot") in a two-part episode aired in 1976 on the television series
        The Six Million Dollar Man. He appeared in other television shows,
        including The Greatest American Hero, B. J. and the Bear, The Fall Guy
        and 1990's Zorro.
      </p>
      <p>
        Towards the end of his career, Roussimoff starred in several films. He
        had an uncredited appearance in the 1984 film Conan the Destroyer as
        Dagoth, the resurrected horned giant god who is killed by Conan (Arnold
        Schwarzenegger). That same year, he also made an appearance in Micki &
        Maude. He appeared most notably as Fezzik, his own favorite role, in the
        1987 film The Princess Bride. Both the film and his performance retain a
        devoted following. In shoot interviews, wrestlers have stated that he
        was so proud of being in "Princess Bride", he carried a copy of the
        movie everywhere he went, to watch whenever he could.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his last film, he appeared in a cameo role as a circus giant in the
        comedy Trading Mom, which was released in 1994, a year after his death.

      <h2>
        Personal Life
      </h2>

      <p>
        Roussimoff was mentioned in the 1974 Guinness Book of World Records as
        the highest-paid wrestler in history at that time. He had earned
        $400,000 in one year during the early 1970s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Robin Christensen is Roussimoff's only child. Her mother Jean (who died
        in 2008) became acquainted with her father through the wrestling
        business around 1972 or 1973. Christensen had almost no connection with
        her father and saw him only five times in her life, despite occasional
        televised and printed news pieces criticizing his absentee fatherhood.
        While she gave some interviews about the subject in her childhood,
        Christensen is reportedly reluctant to discuss her father publicly
        today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roussimoff has been unofficially crowned "the greatest drunk on Earth"
        for once consuming 119 12 oz. beers in six hours. On an episode of WWE's
        Legends of Wrestling, Mike Graham said Roussimoff once drank 156 16 oz.
        beers (over 73 litres (128 imp pt)) in one sitting, which was confirmed
        by Dusty Rhodes. The Fabulous Moolah wrote in her autobiography that
        Roussimoff drank 127 beers in a Reading, Pennsylvania, hotel bar and
        later passed out in the lobby. The staff could not move him and had to
        leave him there until he awoke. In a shoot interview, Ken Patera
        recalled an occasion where Roussimoff was challenged by Dick Murdoch to
        a beer drinking contest. After nine or so hours, Roussimoff had drunk
        116 beers. A tale recounted by Cary Elwes in his book about the making
        of The Princess Bride has Roussimoff falling on top of somebody while
        drunk, after which the NYPD sent an undercover officer to follow
        Roussimoff around whenever he went out drinking in their city to make
        sure he did not fall on anyone again. Another story also says prior to
        his famous WrestleMania III match, Roussimoff drank 14 bottles of wine.
      </p>
      <p>
        William Goldman, the author of the novel and the screenplay of The
        Princess Bride, wrote in his nonfiction work Which Lie Did I Tell? that
        Roussimoff was one of the gentlest and most generous people he ever
        knew. Whenever Roussimoff ate with someone in a restaurant, he would
        pay, but he would also insist on paying when he was a guest. On one
        occasion, after Roussimoff attended a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger
        and Wilt Chamberlain, Schwarzenegger had quietly moved to the cashier to
        pay before Roussimoff could, but then found himself being physically
        lifted, carried from his table and deposited on top of his car by
        Roussimoff and Chamberlain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roussimoff owned a ranch in Ellerbe, North Carolina, looked after by two
        of his close friends, when he was not on the road. He loved spending
        time at the ranch tending to his cattle, playing with his dogs and
        entertaining company. While there were custom-made chairs and a few
        other modifications in his home to account for his size, tales that
        everything in his home was custom-made for a large man are said to be
        exaggerated. Since Roussimoff could not easily go shopping due to his
        fame and size, he was known to spend hours watching QVC and made
        frequent purchases from the shopping channel. Roussimoff had a passion
        for card games, mainly cribbage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roussimoff died in his sleep of congestive heart failure on the night of
        January 27, 1993, in a Paris hotel room. He was found by his chauffeur.
        He was in Paris to attend his father's funeral. While there, Roussimoff
        decided to stay in France longer to be with his mother on her birthday.
        He spent the day before his death visiting and playing cards with some
        of his oldest friends in Molien.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his will, Roussimoff specified that his remains be cremated and
        "disposed of". Upon his death in Paris, his family in France held a
        funeral for him, intending to bury him near his father. When they
        learned of his wish to be cremated, his body was flown to the United
        States, where he was cremated according to his wishes. His ashes were
        scattered at his ranch in Ellerbe, North Carolina. In addition, in
        accordance with his will, he left his estate to his sole beneficiary:
        his daughter Robin.
